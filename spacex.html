    <h3>SPACEX'S APPROACH TO SPACE SUSTAINABILITY AND SAFETY</h3>
    <p>
        SpaceX was founded to revolutionize space technology towards making life multiplanetary. SpaceX is the world’s leading provider of launch services and is proud to be the first private company to have delivered astronauts to and from the International Space Station (ISS), and the first and only company to complete an all-civilian crewed mission to orbit.<br>
         As such, SpaceX is deeply committed to maintaining a safe orbital environment, protecting human spaceflight, and ensuring the environment is kept sustainable for future missions to Earth orbit and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>SpaceX has demonstrated this commitment to space safety through action, investing significant resources to ensure that all our launch vehicles, spacecraft, and satellites meet or exceed space safety regulations and best practices.

        <ul>
            <h3>including:</h3>
    <li>Designing and building highly reliable, maneuverable satellites that have demonstrated reliability of greater than 99%</li>
    <li>Operating at low altitudes (below 600 km) to ensure no persistent debris, even in the unlikely event a satellite fails on orbit</li>
    <li>Inserting satellites at an especially low altitude to verify health prior to raising into their on-station/operational orbit</li>
    <li>Transparently sharing orbital information with other satellite owners/operators</li>
    <li>Developed an advanced collision avoidance system to take effective action when encounter risks exceed safe thresholds</li>
</ul>
    </p>
    <p>SpaceX continues to innovate to accelerate space technologies, and we are currently providing much-needed internet connectivity to people all over the globe, including underserved and remote parts of the world, with our Starlink constellation. <br>Below are our operating principles demonstrating our commitment to space sustainability and safety.</p>
